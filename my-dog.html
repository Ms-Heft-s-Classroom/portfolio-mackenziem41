<p> My dogs name is Jimmy, hes pretty stinkin chill. He likes to watch people out the windows and sit in the sun when its out. <br> He mostly just sleeps though. Hes like super kinda old....</p>

<p> Hes a cutie patootie!! Hes just like super mean sometimes, like when he doesnt lay with me when I wanna lay with him...<br> Hes always dissing and gaslighting me. <br> But hes being him, and he is him.</p>

<p1> He loves me so much even though he never wants to hangout with me, its just like his love language...He super loves me Im being for real. Plus, hed die without me. He should be more grateful.</p1>

<p1> He shouldnt, she dont even like him that much. But, I love him so he should only like me and no one else. I should be his top priority and not my momma bear. Like I literally gave him life, he was nothing wihtout me. I gave him the fame and fortune. </p1>
