    <h4> Who are my bffs? </h4>
      <p1> My best friends are Zoe and Kayla, I wont include last names for their safety. They are such cutie pies that give me so much love. <br> The two of them together are lowkey kinda really scary but its okay because they are my girlies. <br> They are really stinkin funny and im not sure we would be able to make it through a funeral without laughing, sorry not sorry. </p1>

    <h4> My best friends are empaths </h4>
      <p2> Me and my bffs have shared minds, we think the same, we feel the same, we are the same. <br> We are actually long lost mermaid triplets at heart, you can be anything if you put your mind to it.<br> Our auras are just so connected that we pratically just become one when we are together, so be afraid. </p2>
