<p1> For our html unit we obiously learned a lot about the works of html. <br>  We learned a lot about hwo to use html code to structure our websites, and how html can help for us to add different aspects of ourselves into websites. <br> We really just kinda learned that we can do a whole lot with html, we can create paragraphs, headings, insert images, link pages to each other, and even create things like navigation bars. </p1>
